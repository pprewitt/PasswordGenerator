# PasswordGenerator
simple password generator made with JavaScript HTML CSS
# Instructions
we were given some html with an existing Generate Password button. A series of prompts should be asked of the user to confirm character types required. Password should be assembled in the placeholder

# Resources
I found info on the ASCII charcode here: (http://net-comber.com/charset.html)
I found the ways to interact with the clipboard here: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard)
## Deployment

This site is deployed within github pages (https://pprewitt.github.io/PasswordGenerator/)

## Discussion
Another challenging, but fun learning project. The math functions combined with the ASCII char code made the random letter, number etc. functions quite easy. I think this was a little harder to get into "computer think" for me: assembling the various functions and passing values from one to the next, but it came through at the end. I decided to add a copy to clipboard function, which was not required.
